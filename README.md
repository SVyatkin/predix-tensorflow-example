# Overview

This is a simple demo of using Cloud Foundry, Flask, Python 3, and TensorFlow.

## Requirements

- [ ] You must have at minimum a [Predix Free Tier](signup) account.
- [ ] You must have the [Cloud Foundry CLI](cf) and can run `cf login`

# Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/j12y/predix-tensorflow-example
cd predix-tensorflow-example
```

You'll want to change the application name to something unique just for you.

```
cf push --random-route
```

# Results

When you push the app you should see something like the following.

```
App predix-tensorflow-example was started using this command `python app.py`

When combined with the Predix SDK you can start pulling data from services like
Predix Asset and Predix Time Series.  For more information about the SDK see:
